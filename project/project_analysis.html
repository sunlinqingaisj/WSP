	<h2>Site Intent<h2>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	Cape Code Hip Hop & Jazz needs a re-designed website to help them get more students and gain more traffic.  I found some areas that need to be fixed and re-designed. I’m going to make it a six –pages website. All of the categories above at the navigation bar is: home, about, gallery, schedule, summer program and contact us.

	<h3>Validation</h3>
	I use the W3C validator to validate the recent website. The result showed me that the website does not pass the validator test, it has a total of 96 validation errors. This is a big number and we have to correct all of those errors in order to make the re-designed website on the right track. Correcting validation errors can also help the website get better on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) side.
